# Dealing with Redrock (Legacy)

---

# Why March 2022
- Far enough out to allow teams to plan for the work
- Close enough that it won't slow down MFE migrations too much

---

# What packages need to be migrated away from

- `CurrentPageContext from "@quicksilver/context"`
- `CurrentUserContext from "@quicksilver/context"`
- `useCurrentUserContext from "@quicksilver/context"`
- `useCurrentCustomerContext from "@quicksilver/context"`
- `useSplit from "@quicksilver/context"`
- `@quicksilver/nav`
- `@workfront/react-i18n`
- `@marvel/api`
- any direct usages of sentry

---

# Suggested workflow

1. Identify team projects that use NWE deprecated packages
2. Add tasks for the work your team needs to complete
3. Use provided codemods to migrate
4. Validate
5. Ship

# Next Beta of MFE migration

import Triangle from './images/mfe-triangle.png'

<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
  <img src={Triangle} alt="" className="max-h-80 max-w-full mx-auto "/>
</div>
